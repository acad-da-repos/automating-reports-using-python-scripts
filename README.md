# Automating Reports using Python Scripts Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will learn how to automate the creation of simple reports using Python. This is a practical skill that can save a lot of time and effort in data analysis workflows.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find a function definition: `generate_report(data, output_file)`.
3.  Your task is to:
    *   Take a Pandas DataFrame as input.
    *   Calculate the mean of a specified column (e.g., 'Sales').
    *   Write a simple text report to the `output_file` that includes the calculated mean.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How can you generate more complex reports, including tables and charts, using libraries like `ReportLab` or `fpdf`?
*   How can you automate the distribution of these reports via email?
*   Explore how to schedule your Python script to run automatically at specific intervals.
